# I'm Nate Sales, a student and software developer. 👋

### Here are some of the projects I'm working on:
- 📫 [PacketFrame](https://packetframe.com/) - Anycast CDN for students, nonprofits, and amateur radio operators.
- 📍 [cTrace](https://www.catlin.edu/posts/~board/stories/post/catlin-gabel-students-invent-app-to-track-on-campus-movement-during-covid-19) - Contact tracing and reporting for COVID-19
- 🤖 [Team 1540](https://team1540.org) - Robot software manager for Team 1540, building autonomous robot control code.
- 🌐 [AS34553](https://natesales.net/network) - Infrastructure platform for supporting personal projects as well as those led by students, nonprofits, and amateur radio operators.
- 🧅 [Emerald Onion](https://emeraldonion.org) - Tor host with a mission to protect privacy, anonymity, access to information, and free speech online.
- 💻 [Fosshost](https://fosshost.org) - Not-for-profit provider of free to use and accessible cloud-hosting services to the free and open source software community. 
- 📡 [ARIX](https://arxi.dev) - ARIX, the Amateur Radio Internet Exchange, is an internet exchange point for licensed amateur radio operators for the use of networking research, development, and education around internet routing.

### And a few of my smaller utilities/programs:
- [bcg](https://github.com/natesales/bcg) - BGP filter and peering automation utility. Takes care of RPKI, IRR, and max prefix limits automatically from PeeringDB.
- [stping](https://github.com/natesales/stping) - Simultaneously send ICMP pings from multiple source IPs at the same time. Handy for tuning transit prefs and troubleshooting connecitivty issues.
